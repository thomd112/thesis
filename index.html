<!-- <p>Introduction</p>

          <p>◉ Madhubani or Mithila painting is a folk art of the Mithila region. The Mithila region includes the north of Bihar and the eastern Terai of Nepal.

            Madhubani paintings are traditionally done by women painters from the Mithila region. They live in a small society, and every mother teaches her daughter the art of making Madhubani paintings.
            
           Since ancient times, women of the Mithila region have painted the walls and floors of their homes with Madhubani paintings to celebrate occasions such as religious festivals, births, and marriages.</p>
           <p>◉ The paintings on the walls are known as Bhitti Chitra and the paintings on the floor are known as Aripana.</p>

   <p> ◉ Paintings were typically done on walls during holidays, religious celebrations, and other significant life events like marriage, birth, and the Upanayanam.</p>
   <p>◉ Over 5000 registered Madhubani painting artists make various hand painted products for livelihood. Some of the products are:-
